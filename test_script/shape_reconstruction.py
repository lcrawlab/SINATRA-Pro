#' @export
#' @description Given a set of variable importances, threshold, the function reconstructs the vertices above the threshold
#' by intersecting the sub-level sets of the directions in a cone with variable importance greater than the threshold.
#' This function loops over each cone, and computes the reconstructed vertices using intersections of sub-level sets. The vertices
#' from each cone are then unioned in the end for the final set of reconstructed vertices.
#'
#'@param dir (nx3 matrix) The matrix of directions that were used compute the (S/D) EC curve over.


##########'@param complex (list) : The list containing metadata of the Vertices, Edges, and Faces of the mesh (use process_off_file_v3 to obtain).

#'@param rate_vals (vector) : Vector of variable importances for each sub-level set across each direction
#'@param len (int) : The number of sub-level sets to compute the (S/D) EC curve on in each direction.
#'@param threshold (float) : The threshold for determining which sub-level sets are used for the reconstruction.
#'@param cone_size (int) : The number of directions in each cone.
#'@param ball_radius (float) : The radius of the ball to compute the (S/D) EC on; if you want the curve to be computed relative to the shape, don't touch this parameter.
#'@param ball (boolean) : Determining whether or not to compute the (S/D) EC curve on a ball for uniform comparisons.
#'@param ec_type (string) : What type of EC curve to compute. Currently we support ECT (Euler Characteristic Curve), SECT (Smooth Euler Characteristic Curve)
#'@param radius (int) : The number of sub-level sets "before" and "after" the selected sub-level sets we want to include.
#'Setting Radius = 1 is recommened.
#'
#'@return total_selected_vertices (vector) : Vector of the vertex indices that are reconstructed.
