# SINATRA_python

Wai Shing Tang 10/22/2020

This is a python version of SINATRA I am writing (translating from the R version). I am testing and applying this scripts on persistent homology analysis on structures of protein, specifically beta-lactamase. New python scripts added for reconstructing average PIP on vertices from varbvs PIP.
